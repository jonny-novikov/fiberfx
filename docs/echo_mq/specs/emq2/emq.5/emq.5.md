## 0 · The as-built floor — what "batches" stand on

Batches are a Movement II **consume** family. The **PRODUCE half already ships** and is NOT re-built here:
`EchoMQ.Jobs.enqueue_many/3` (bulk enqueue, emq.1/emq.2.2). What emq.5 builds is the **batch CONSUME** family — a
worker that fetches up to *N* jobs in one atomic claim instead of one at a time, amortizing the per-job round-trip
and lease bookkeeping across the batch.

The mechanism is **reserved, not invented** (design `emq.design.md` §6.2, lines 457–464): *"Count-variant pops
remain the 6.2-level surface the batch family builds on at its rung."* A batch claim is a **count-variant
`ZPOPMIN` INSIDE the claim script** — never a client-side `LMPOP`/`ZMPOP` (those are rejected by design because a
client pop bypasses the script layer's atomic event/bookkeeping path). The just-shipped **`@gwclaim` (emq.4.4)
already proves the exact shape**: it loops `ZPOPMIN lane` *K* times under one server-clock `TIME` read, leasing the
whole batch on one deadline. emq.5.1 is the non-grouped generalization of that proven loop.

What each axis stands on (all SHIPPED, present-tense):

- `EchoMQ.Jobs.claim/3` + `@claim` (the single `ZPOPMIN emq:{q}:pending` claim, server-clock lease, attempts as the
  fencing token; `jobs.ex:165` the script, `jobs.ex:418` the host fn → `{:ok, {id, payload, att}}` on a hit, `:empty`
  on an empty pending set, the queue-wide pause honored host-side FIRST) — the spine generalizes this, returning a
  LIST of `{id, payload, att}` members.
- `EchoMQ.Lanes` + the ring (`emq:{q}:ring`) + `@gwclaim`/`@gclaim` + `emq:{q}:gactive`/`gweight` — the affinity +
  concurrency rung composes with this (emq.4, CLOSED).
- `EchoMQ.Consumer` (the park-don't-poll loop; the emq.4.3 `EchoMQ.Metronome` dispatch) — the shaping rung extends
  this.
- `EchoMQ.Events` (the host pub/sub seam) — batch lifecycle events register here, additive-minor.
- `@complete`/`@retry` (per-member resolution) + `@schedule`/`enqueue_at` (the schedule fence) — the partitioned
  finish + dynamic delay reuse these **byte-frozen**.

## 1 · The carve (size + recommended topology)

Each headline item in the roadmap's emq.5 row — *bulk consumption · `min_size`/`timeout` shaping · affinity · the
partitioned finish* — becomes one sub-rung, in the spine→shaping→composition→capstone shape emq.4 used.

| Rung | Ships (PROPOSED) | Stands on | Size | Risk | Recommended topology |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **emq.5.1 ✅ SHIPPED** | **the batch-claim spine** — `@bclaim` (count-variant `ZPOPMIN emq:{q}:pending` up to `size` under one `TIME`, one batch lease, attempts per member) + `Jobs.claim_batch/4` + the manual-pull host API; partial-failure isolation rides the shipped per-member `@complete`/`@retry` (a *tested* property, not new Lua) | `@claim` · `@gwclaim` (the proven multi-pop loop) · `emq:{q}:pending`/`active` | **M** | **NORMAL** (additive Lua, `@claim` byte-frozen) **+ the ≥100 determinism loop** (a mint/lease surface) | **Flat-L2** — Venus → Director ruled FORK 5.1-A → the LOOP / 5.1-B → THREE (conf 64) / 5.1-C → short batch → Mars build → Director verify PASS → done (zero remediation; Apollo optional, not run) |
| **emq.5.2 ✅ SHIPPED** | **`min_size`/`timeout` shaping** — `EchoMQ.BatchConsumer` (a NEW watch-depth process, a SIBLING of `Consumer` — D-1) flushes ONE batch when the size floor (`min_size`) or the latency ceiling (`timeout`) is reached, draining via the byte-frozen `@bclaim`/`claim_batch/4`; a **pure shaping core** `EchoMQ.BatchShaper.Core` (`decide/4`, injected clock); a per-member verdict map (absent → fail-safe retry — D-2); per-member events on the `EchoMQ.Events` seam | emq.5.1 · `EchoMQ.Consumer` (the lifecycle precedent) · `EchoMQ.Events` | **M** | **NORMAL** (new supervised process + pure core; **no new Lua/lease**) | **Flat-L2** — Venus → Director ruled D-1/D-2/D-3 → Mars build → Director verify PASS (mutation spot-check net-zero) → **Mars-2 collapsed** (right-size, zero findings); conf 67, `60de5dc8` |
| **emq.5.3 ✅ SHIPPED** | **group-affinity batch** — `@gbclaim` (a NEW additive lane script — D-1) rotates the ring (`LMOVE`) and serves a HOMOGENEOUS batch from the landed lane up to the `glimit` headroom (ring-rotated, no caller group — D-1 5.3-C; the `@gwclaim` isomorph minus the `gweight` read, K = min(depth, headroom)) + `Lanes.bclaim/3`; reuse `gactive` (D-1 5.3-B) | emq.5.1 · **the CLOSED emq.4 ring** (`@gwclaim`/`gactive`/`gweight`) | **M–L** | **NORMAL+** (additive `@gbclaim`; shipped `@g*`/`@bclaim` byte-frozen) | **Flat-L2 + Apollo** — Venus → Director ruled D-1 (3 forks; 5.3-C NEW, surfaced at reconcile) → Mars build → Director verify PASS (declared-keys + byte-freeze battery + a mutation 6/10 + the ≥100 loop 100/100) → Mars-2 (the label fix); conf 70, `a299aa73` |
| **emq.5.4** | **the partitioned finish + dynamic delay** — a batch resolves as a **partition** (complete / retry-poison-alone / dead) via the shipped per-member transitions; `Jobs.delay/N` re-scores an active member onto the schedule set from the handler | `@complete`/`@retry` · `@schedule`/`enqueue_at` (all **byte-frozen**) · emq.5.1 | **M** | **NORMAL** (reuses shipped, byte-frozen transitions; **no new lease surface**) | **Flat-L2** — Venus → Director → Mars → Director verify (byte-freeze the reused scripts) → Mars-2. Apollo optional |

**Family total ≈ 4 rungs, ~4–5 rung-points** (comparable to emq.4). One new additive Lua script per claim rung
(`@bclaim`, `@gbclaim`); zero new Lua in 5.2 and 5.4.

## 2 · Build order & dependencies

```
emq.5.1  batch-claim spine   ──►  everything below builds on @bclaim
   ├─► emq.5.2  shaping ✅    (rides 5.1; independent of 5.3)
   ├─► emq.5.3  affinity ✅   (rides 5.1 + the CLOSED emq.4 ring)
   └─► emq.5.4  finish        (rides 5.1 + byte-frozen @complete/@retry/@schedule)
```

- **5.1 is the spine** — it must land first; 5.2/5.3/5.4 each ride `@bclaim`.
- **5.3 was gate-blocked on emq.4** ("affinity gates on emq.4's deepened rotation" — features.md C.3 §Scope). **emq.4
  is now CLOSED, so 5.3 is UNBLOCKED** — a direct dividend of this reconcile's family fold.
- 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 are mutually independent (all ride only 5.1) — the program ships one rung per run, but the Operator
  may re-order 5.2↔5.3↔5.4 freely after 5.1.

## 3 · Family version & conformance posture

- **Additive minors, 2.x line.** Each rung grows the conformance count from **61** (+ batch scenarios, prior
  byte-unchanged, re-pinned in both pinning tests) and is a host-verb/script addition — no new wire class.
- **The two planes hold (the emq.4.3-D4 model).** The wire `@wire_version` stays **frozen at `echomq:2.4.2`** unless
  a rung genuinely changes claim wire-behavior (none is foreseen — `@bclaim`/`@gbclaim` are additive *new* scripts,
  not edits to a shipped one); the `mix.exs` **rung label** climbs (emq.5.1 RULED **`2.5.0`**, opening the family).
  The `:fence` scenario + `connector_test` stay version-agnostic.
- **Determinism posture per rung:** 5.1 and 5.3 are **mint/lease surfaces → the ≥100 determinism loop** (the
  same-millisecond branded-`JOB` mint hazard the loop owns). 5.2 and 5.4 introduce **no new mint/lease** → a
  multi-seed sweep + an honest posture statement (5.2's only nondeterminism is the shaping timer, isolated in the
  pure core with an injected clock).

## 4 · Forks (open Operator decisions — settle at each rung's pre-build reconcile)

Framed forward; each is the architect's four-part Arm at the rung, ruled via `AskUserQuestion` before that build.

- **FORK 5.1-A — the count mechanism.** `ZPOPMIN emq:{q}:pending <count>` (the native count arg, one call) **vs** a
  `ZPOPMIN`-loop (the shipped `@gwclaim` shape, per-member attempts/lease bookkeeping in the loop). *Lean:* the loop,
  for symmetry with `@gwclaim` and per-member fencing.
- **FORK 5.2-A — the shaping home.** A batch-aware **mode on `EchoMQ.Consumer`** (additive) **vs** a new
  `EchoMQ.BatchConsumer` process. *Lean:* a mode on the shipped Consumer.
- **FORK 5.3-A — the affinity claim (risk-deciding).** An **additive `@gbclaim`** (NORMAL+, `@gwclaim`/`@gclaim`
  byte-frozen) **vs** extending `@gwclaim` to a batch-return (edits a frozen fairness script → **HIGH** + byte-freeze
  every other lane script + Apollo mandatory). *Lean:* additive `@gbclaim`.
- **FORK 5.3-B — the batch-concurrency home.** Reuse **`gactive`** (a batch counts as its `size` against the group
  ceiling) **vs** a new `gbatch` in-flight counter. *Lean:* reuse `gactive` (no new key, the §6 grammar unedited).
- **FORK 5.4-A — dynamic delay.** A new `Jobs.delay/N` re-score (active → schedule, reusing `@schedule`) **vs** fold
  into the shipped promote/schedule surface. *Lean:* a thin `delay/N` over the byte-frozen schedule fence.
