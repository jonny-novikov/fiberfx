## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all functional requirements
- **Functional Requirements (Phase 3-11)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - FR-7 (Producer) should be implemented first (needed for testing other features)
  - FR-1/FR-2 (Worker) second (core consumption logic)
  - FR-3/FR-4/FR-5/FR-6 can proceed in parallel after FR-1/FR-2
  - FR-8/FR-9/FR-10 can proceed in parallel
- **NFR-2/NFR-3 (Phase 12-13)**: Depend on FR-1/FR-2 completion
- **NFR-4/NFR-5 (Phase 14-15)**: Can start after all functional requirements complete
- **NFR-1 (Phase 16)**: Requires all features complete for load testing
- **Examples/Docs (Phase 17)**: Can proceed in parallel with NFR tests
- **Polish (Phase 18)**: Depends on all previous phases

### User Story (Functional Requirement) Dependencies

- **FR-7 (Producer)**: No dependencies - implement first for testing
- **FR-1/FR-2 (Worker)**: Depends on FR-7 (need jobs to consume)
- **FR-3 (Stalled)**: Depends on FR-1/FR-2 (needs active jobs to stall)
- **FR-4 (Retry)**: Depends on FR-1/FR-2/FR-6 (needs job processing and completion)
- **FR-5 (Progress)**: Depends on FR-1/FR-2 (needs active jobs)
- **FR-6 (Completion)**: Depends on FR-1/FR-2 (needs job processing)
- **FR-8 (Queue Mgmt)**: Depends on FR-7 (needs queues with jobs)
- **FR-9 (Cluster)**: No dependencies (validation of key builder)
- **FR-10 (Events)**: Depends on FR-1/FR-2/FR-6 (needs job lifecycle)

### Within Each Functional Requirement

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Data structures before logic
- Core operations before advanced features
- Unit tests before integration tests

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, FR-9 (Cluster tests) can run in parallel with FR-7 (Producer)
- FR-3/FR-4/FR-5 can run in parallel after FR-1/FR-2/FR-6 complete
- FR-8/FR-10 can run in parallel
- All NFR tests (Phase 12-16) can run in parallel if functional requirements are complete
- All Examples/Docs tasks can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all data structure definitions together:
Task: "Define Job struct in pkg/bullmq/job.go"
Task: "Define JobOptions and BackoffConfig structs in pkg/bullmq/job.go"
Task: "Define WorkerOptions struct in pkg/bullmq/worker.go"
Task: "Define Event struct in pkg/bullmq/events.go"
Task: "Define error types in pkg/bullmq/errors.go"
Task: "Define JobCounts struct in pkg/bullmq/queue.go"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (FR-7 + FR-1/FR-2 + FR-6 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all features)
3. Complete Phase 3: FR-7 (Producer API)
4. Complete Phase 4: FR-1/FR-2 (Worker API)
5. Complete Phase 5: FR-2/FR-6 (Completion & Heartbeat)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test basic producer→worker→completion flow
7. Deploy examples, validate with Node.js BullMQ

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add FR-7 (Producer) → Test independently → Can add jobs!
3. Add FR-1/FR-2 (Worker) → Test independently → Can process jobs!
4. Add FR-6 (Completion) → Test independently → Jobs complete/fail!
5. Add FR-3 (Stalled) → Test independently → Crash recovery works!
6. Add FR-4 (Retry) → Test independently → Retries work!
7. Continue with remaining features...

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational complete):

1. Developer A: FR-7 (Producer)
2. Developer B: FR-1/FR-2 (Worker core)
3. Developer C: FR-9 (Cluster tests)
4. Once FR-1/FR-2 complete:
   - Developer D: FR-3 (Stalled)
   - Developer E: FR-4 (Retry)
   - Developer F: FR-5 (Progress)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific functional requirement (FR-X) or phase (Setup, Foundation)
- Each functional requirement should be independently completable and testable
- TDD is MANDATORY: Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate feature independently
- Lua scripts are sacred - validate against upstream BullMQ on every change
- Redis Cluster compatibility is P0 - test early and often
- Cross-language compatibility is critical - validate against Node.js BullMQ regularly

## Bug Fixes & Post-Implementation Issues

### 2025-10-31: Integration Test Failures Resolved

**Context**: Integration tests T039-T057 were marked complete but failing in practice. Root cause analysis revealed critical bugs.

#### Bug #1: ZPopMin Error Handling (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `pkg/bullmq/worker_impl.go:78-83`

**Symptom**: Worker picked up priority jobs but **never processed wait queue jobs**. Tests timed out.

**Root Cause**:
```go
// BUGGY CODE:
results, err := w.redisClient.ZPopMin(ctx, kb.Prioritized(), 1).Result()
if err == nil && len(results) > 0 {
    jobID = results[0].Member.(string)
} else if err != redis.Nil {
    return err  // BUG: Returns nil when queue empty!
}
```

**Issue**: `ZPopMin` on empty/non-existent key returns `err=nil` (NOT `redis.Nil`!), while `RPop` returns `redis.Nil`.

**Impact**: When prioritized queue is empty:
1. `err == nil` → true
2. `len(results) == 0` → true
3. Enters `else if err != redis.Nil` branch
4. `nil != redis.Nil` → true
5. Returns `nil` (success) without picking job
6. `pickupJob()` returns success → semaphore stays acquired
7. Start() loop thinks job was picked, continues immediately
8. **Never reaches wait queue check** → infinite loop

**Fix**:
```go
// FIXED CODE:
results, err := w.redisClient.ZPopMin(ctx, kb.Prioritized(), 1).Result()
if err != nil && err != redis.Nil {
    // Only return on actual errors, not empty queue
    return err
}
if len(results) > 0 {
    jobID = results[0].Member.(string)
}
// Continue to wait queue check if no priority jobs
```

**Tests Fixed**: T039, T041, T042, T043, T044, T055, T056, T057 (8 tests)

---

#### Bug #2: JobOptions Validation Too Strict

**Location**: `pkg/bullmq/queue_impl.go:14-16`, `pkg/bullmq/validation.go:32-44`

**Symptom**: `Queue.Add()` failed with validation errors when user omitted optional fields:
```
validation error: attempts: must be > 0, got 0
validation error: backoff.type: must be 'fixed' or 'exponential', got ''
```

**Root Cause**: Validation ran **before** applying defaults. Zero values were rejected.

**Issue**: API required explicit values for fields that should have sensible defaults (matches BullMQ Node.js behavior).

**Fix**:
```go
// Apply defaults BEFORE validation
if opts.Attempts == 0 {
    opts.Attempts = 1  // BullMQ default
}
if opts.Attempts > 1 && opts.Backoff.Type == "" {
    opts.Backoff = BackoffConfig{Type: "exponential", Delay: 1000}
}

// Validate backoff only if specified
if opts.Backoff.Type != "" {
    if err := ValidateBackoffConfig(opts.Backoff); err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
```

**Tests Fixed**: T040, T056, T057 (3 tests - overlaps with Bug #1)

---

#### Bug #3: Test Variable Naming

**Location**: `tests/integration/worker_test.go:75, 93`

**Symptom**: Test assertion compared `*bullmq.Job` to `string` directly.

**Root Cause**: Variable named `highPriorityID` actually stored `*bullmq.Job`, not `string`.

**Fix**:
```go
// BEFORE:
highPriorityID, err := queue.Add(...)
assert.Equal(t, highPriorityID, id)  // Comparing *Job to string

// AFTER:
highPriorityJob, err := queue.Add(...)
assert.Equal(t, highPriorityJob.ID, id)  // Correct
```

**Tests Fixed**: T040 (already fixed by Bug #2)

---

### Lessons Learned

1. **Redis client API differences**: `ZPopMin` returns `err=nil` for empty queues, `RPop` returns `redis.Nil`. Document quirks.

2. **Integration tests critical**: Unit tests passed but integration tests revealed real-world issues.

3. **Default values in public APIs**: Always apply sensible defaults before validation for better UX.

4. **Test variable naming**: Use descriptive names matching actual type (`job` not `jobID` when storing `*Job`).

5. **Error handling**: Always check both error **and** result length when result can be empty array.

---

### Verification

All 10 Worker integration tests now pass:
```
✅ TestWorker_PickupFromWaitQueue
✅ TestWorker_PickupPriorityOrder
✅ TestWorker_RespectsPausedQueue
✅ TestWorker_LockAcquiredWithUUIDv4
✅ TestWorker_AtomicWaitToActive
✅ TestWorker_LockTTL
✅ TestWorker_MoveToCompleted
✅ TestWorker_MoveToFailed
✅ TestWorker_RemoveOnComplete
✅ TestWorker_DebugWaitQueue (diagnostic)
```

**Command**: `go test -v ./tests/integration -run TestWorker`
**Result**: `PASS` (all tests, 6.017s)
